# Docker

- proxy issue: can't reach docker repo (so sad)
  - please double check /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf 
 
        ```
        $ sudo docker run hello-world
        Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
        docker: Error response from daemon: Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: Couldn't connect: Connection refused.
        ```
